## Requirements
[FastLed](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) and [ArduinoFHT](https://github.com/Evg33/ArduinoFHT) libraries are required for this program. Install them via your library manager.

## How to use
If you are using Arduino IDE, then change `.cpp` extention to `.ino`.

If you are using PlatformIO, then just change your `main.cpp` to this file.

## Warning
ArduinoFHT and many leds use quite a bit of RAM, so this project doesn't work on ATmega328P (Arduino Uno/Nano). Use something like Mega2560 instead.
